    I use my own methods of retrieving images internally
    I also use a custom discord bot to handle the input
    input must start with ```art
    values 
    on
    newline
    ```
    end with 3 backticks
    
    input must include a background denoted by -b
    
    links can be set for the background and meta images
    
    ```
